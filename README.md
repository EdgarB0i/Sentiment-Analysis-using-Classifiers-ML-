# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Classifiers
Using popular classifier models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Naive Bayes etc. we performed sentiment analysis i.e determining whether a review is positive or negative. The used dataset "Restaurant_Reviews.tsv" has also been included.

A project report has also been made that highlights all the information on the used dataset, dataset manipulation, information about the models and comparison between their performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1Score).
